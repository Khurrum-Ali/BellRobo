# Robot Simulator

A simple React-based robot simulator that allows you to control a robot on a 5x5 grid. The robot can rotate in place to face any of the four cardinal directions (NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST) and move forward in the direction it is facing. It uses CSS transitions for smooth rotation animations and a clean UI for easy controls.

## Features

- **Grid-based Movement**: Move the robot forward on a 5x5 grid.
- **Rotation**: Rotate the robot left or right to face different directions.
- **Smooth Animations**: The robot smoothly rotates to its new direction using CSS transitions.
- **React Hooks**: Built using Reactâ€™s state management and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- **Simple UI**: A minimalistic interface for easy interaction.
